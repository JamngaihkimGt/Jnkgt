		The theorem was first proved by Cauchy in 1823 as a corollary of a proof of the mean value theorem. <br>The name "Rolle's theorem" was first used by Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch of Germany in 1834 and by Giusto Bellavitis of Italy in 1846.<br><br>

		Although the theorem is named after Michel Rolle, Rolle's 1691 proof covered only the case of polynomial functions.<br> His proof did not use the methods of differential calculus, which at that point in his life he considered to be fallacious.<br> The theorem was first proved by Cauchy in 1823 as a corollary of a proof of the mean value theorem.<br> The name "Rolle's theorem" was first used by Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch of Germany in 1834 and by Giusto Bellavitis of Italy in 1846.
