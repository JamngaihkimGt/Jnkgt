		<strong>Some Examples </strong> 
	</h1>
Verify Rolle’s theorem for the function y = x2 + 2, a = –2 and b = 2.

Solution:<br><br>

From the definition of Rolle’s theorem, the function y = x2 + 2 is continuous in [– 2, 2] and differentiable in (– 2, 2).<br>

From the given,<br>

f(x) = x2 + 2<br>

f(-2) = (-2)2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6<br>

f(2) = (2)2 + 2 = 4 + 2= 6<br>

Thus, f(– 2) = f( 2) = 6<br>

Hence, the value of f(x) at –2 and 2 coincide.<br>

Now, f'(x) = 2x <br>

Rolle’s theorem states that there is a point c ∈ (– 2, 2) such that f′(c) = 0.<br> 

At c = 0, f′(c) = 2(0) = 0, where c = 0 ∈ (– 2, 2)<br>

Hence verified.
