	Rolle's Theorem states that if<br>
			i) f(x) is continuous in the closed interval [a,b]<br>
			ii)f(x) exists in the open interval (a,b) and<br>
			iii)f(a)=f(b),then<br><br>
			there exists atleast a point between a and b i.e (a,b) such that f(c)=0<br>
			<br>In other words,if a continuous curve passes through the same y-value (such as the x-axis) twice and has a unique tangent line (derivative) at every point on the interval, then somewhere between the end points it has a tangent parallel to the x-axis.<br>
			It is also used to prove the Mean Value Theorem.<br><br>
			<p>	The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function f is continuous on the closed interval [a,b] and differentiable on the open interval (a,b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a,b) such that f'(c) is equal to the function's average rate of change over [a,b].<br><p>	The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function f is continuous on the closed interval [a,b] and differentiable on the open interval (a,b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a,b) such that f'(c) is equal to the function's average rate of change over [a,b].</p>
