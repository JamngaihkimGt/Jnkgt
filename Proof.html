		<strong>Proof: </strong> 
	</h1>
Since f(a)=f(b), if the function f is constant in the interval [a,b],then f'(x)=0 for every point x in (a,b).
<br>If f is not constant, then the function f may have values greater than or equal to or less than or equal to f(a) or both.
<br>Let f(x)≥f(a) for every x belongs to [a,b]. Since f is continuous in [a,b], we have, f is bounded and attains its bounds.
<br>Let M be the supremum of the function f in [a,b]. Then there exists atleast a point c belonging to (a,b) such that f(c)=M, we show that f'(c)=0.
<br>Here, we have, f(c+h)-f(c) ≤ 0 for +ve as well as -ve values of h.<br>
∴ f(c+h)-f(c)/h≤ 0 if h is +ve and f(c+h)-f(c)/h≥0 if h is -ve.
<br>But f'(x) exists for every point x belonging to (a,b) and so f'(c) exists. Therefore, the above two limits must exist and be equal. And the only possible equal value is zero. Thus,we have f'(c)=0.
<br>If f(x) ≤ f(a) for every x belonging to [a,b],then there is atleast a point c such that f(c)=m, m being the infimum. Then, we can similarly show that f'(c)=0.<br>
Finally if the function has values both greater than or less than or equal to f(a), then we can similarly show that f'(x)=0 for which f(x)=M or f(x)=m, M and m being the supremum and infimum of the function.
<br>Hence proved.
