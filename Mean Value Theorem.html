		<strong>Mean Value Theorem </strong> 
	</h1>
	<br>The mean value theorem states that for any function f(x) whose graph passes through two given points (a, f(a)), (b, f(b)), there is at least one point (c, f(c)) on the curve where the tangent is parallel to the secant passing through the two given points.<br> The mean value theorem is defined herein calculus for a function f(x): [a, b] â†’ R, such that it is continuous and differentiable across an interval.<br>

The function f(x) is continuous over the interval [a, b].
<br>The function f(x) is differentiable over the interval (a, b).
<br>There exists a point c in (a, b) such that f'(c) = [ f(b) - f(a) ] / (b - a).
